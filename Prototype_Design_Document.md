# GeneoGraph Prototype: Current Design and Engineering Guide

**Reviewed:** 2026-10-23
**Scope:** The working prototype in `src/`, not a specification of a shipped service.

## 1. What this document describes

GeneoGraph is a project-based family-history research workspace. The prototype connects a structured family tree with person profiles, photographs, research files, notes, places, and free-form Geneograph boards. It demonstrates interactions and visual direction with seeded sample data. It is not a durable multi-user application.

## 2. Running the prototype

- Open `src/index.html` directly or serve `src/` as static files. There is no framework, package manager, compile step, or backend.
- `src/index.html` contains the shell, CDN references, runtime map configuration, and ordered stylesheet and classic deferred script tags. The order is significant: the scripts share a global scope rather than importing modules.
- Styles live in `src/*.css`; behavior, seed records, state, localization, and validation live in `src/*.js`. Photographs and other static media live in `src/assets/`. Local vendor files support document and board export/preview paths.
- Leaflet and Quill are pinned CDN dependencies. Mapping also depends on a configured MapTiler key and network access. A file-open or offline session may not exercise every external-resource path.
- The current root-based GitHub Pages configuration does not publish the application from `src/`. Local behavior and a Pages deployment are not interchangeable evidence.

The main shell exposes a top bar, project/module navigation, workspace, right inspector, modals, and toasts. The visible modules are **Family Tree, People, Geneograph, Albums, Archive, Notes, and Places**. `Publish` has implementation files but is intentionally absent from the active module list in `src/runtime-config.js`.

## 3. Product and interaction principles

| Principle | Current design consequence |
| --- | --- |
| One research project, connected views | Records are scoped by project and referenced by stable IDs across modules. A profile, board card, photo, or place should not become an independent copy of the underlying record by accident. |
| Structured genealogy plus visual exploration | Family Tree is relationship-oriented; Geneograph is a flexible research canvas. They share people but have different layout and editing rules. |
| Direct manipulation with an inspector | Select an object to reveal relevant content, appearance, layout, and geometry controls. Multi-selection exposes only sensible shared operations. |
| Explicit provenance | Board-only and project-linked media or places are distinguished. Visual connection arrows do not imply a genealogical relationship. |
| Prototype truthfulness | Working local actions must be distinguished from simulated import, publishing, persistence, or service integrations. |

The visual identity is a dark, low-glare work surface with restrained green primary actions and semantic accents. `src/foundation.css` defines the shared color, type, spacing, border, and motion tokens. Geneograph uses compact tool surfaces and a dotted/grid-capable canvas. Avoid treating the old document's individual bug-fix notes as lasting design rules.

## 4. Architecture and state

### Runtime organization

- `src/sample-data.js` establishes the seeded `sampleData` graph. `seed-genealogy.js` and `seed-boards.js` enrich it at load time; `validation.js` checks assumptions.
- `src/state-tree-core.js` owns central UI state. `app-shell.js` dispatches rendering; feature files such as `people.js`, `geneograph.js`, `albums.js`, `archive.js`, `notes.js`, and `places.js` implement module behavior.
- `shared-media.js` and `shared-actions.js` contain cross-view media resolution and actions. Geneograph board files, PNG export, and Tree transfer/import have their own focused files.
- DOM rendering and event binding are largely imperative. This is an extracted multi-file application, but not yet a modular ES-module architecture or a persistent domain layer.

### Source of truth and lifetime

The prototype's project, person, relationship, note, media metadata, place, and board changes primarily mutate browser memory. Reloading restores the seeded experience rather than a saved account. Some interface preferences use browser storage; that is not project persistence. A downloaded `.ggboard` file is an explicit portable board snapshot, not autosave. Browser-local uploads and archive document imports have limited session lifetime unless exported through an applicable flow.

Use IDs and project scoping when resolving records. Derive display labels, counts, and links from canonical records where possible. Do not infer a stable domain field from a translated label or an inspector string. Board overrides are distinct from board defaults and from person data.

### Record ownership

| Record or state | Owner in the prototype | Important distinction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project and default person | Central sample-data graph | A blank project can be created in memory, but there is no account-backed save. |
| Person and family relationships | Project data | People, Profile, and Family Tree resolve shared IDs. A Geneograph card may display that person without owning the canonical Tree record. |
| Photo and album metadata | Project data | A project photo may be reused in profiles and boards. A board-only avatar asset has different scope. |
| Archive, note, and place records | Project data | Browser-local imported binaries have a shorter lifetime than their visible metadata. |
| Geneograph board and board-person records | Selected project | Multiple cards may refer to one board person. Nodes, connection routing, and board assets belong to the board. |
| Canvas/card/connection defaults | Geneograph board | Inherited appearance can change when a default changes. An explicit node or line override should not. |
| Active tool, selection, viewport, and open popovers | UI session | These are interaction state, not genealogy facts. Creation-strip choices are board-scoped and temporary. |
| Language and continuation preferences | Browser storage | Remembered UI preferences do not imply durable project data. |

When removing or replacing a record, inspect all references to its ID and the effect on both structured views and board views. When changing a board default, test inherited and customized objects separately. When editing a person photo, distinguish the project portrait, Geneograph board-person override, and an individual card's Photo visibility.

### Localization

`src/localization.js` supplies English and Russian UI strings and language state. New visible actions, empty states, errors, tooltips, and accessibility names need both languages. Keep canonical data and machine identifiers separate from translated display text. Some older feature copy may still be literal English; localization completeness needs testing rather than assumption.

## 5. Shared application flows

**Projects.** A user can navigate projects and create a blank project in the in-memory model. The GEDCOM import chooser remains simulated; it does not parse a `.ged` file into people and relationships. Project settings, deletion, and continuation UI should be evaluated against the current in-memory lifetime, not described as account-backed services.

**Search, sorting, and selection.** People and other collections provide module-specific search, filters, sorting, selected items, and batch actions. Keep filter logic on stable record fields, preserve selection context when opening detail views, and show mixed values explicitly rather than silently taking the first selected object's value.

**Dates and places.** Genealogy dates may be exact, approximate, ranged, or unknown. Display and input logic should preserve the recorded value and uncertainty rather than treating every date as a JavaScript timestamp. Place references should be resolved through project or board context; a typed map result and a board-only place have different consequences.

**Modals and feedback.** Creation/editing dialogs stage input, expose a clear primary action and cancel path, and return actionable errors. Long lists scroll inside the modal while footer actions remain reachable. Tooltips and toasts support feedback but should not be the sole carrier of essential state.

## 6. People, Profile, and Family Tree

### People and Profile

The People directory presents project people with search/filter/sort and bulk operations. A person's role relative to the project's default person is derived from relationships, not maintained as a separate manually edited label. Profile brings identity, life facts, relations, photos, notes, places, and research connections together. Add/Edit Person uses the shared person model; changes can be reflected in other views of that record.

Names include given, middle, surname, and where recorded a maiden surname. Living status and life dates affect display and privacy-oriented copy. Portraits resolve a primary project photo where available and otherwise use initials. Photo selection and association are prototype interactions over the current in-memory data; they do not upload to a production media service.

### Family Tree

Family Tree is the structured relationship view. It uses layout and connector logic to render people, partner groups, parents, children, and family junctions. Card actions open the established person and relationship workflows. The tree and People/Profile views refer to the same underlying records. Tree geometry and relationship constraints are implementation-owned in `projects-tree-layout.js` and `family-and-shared.js`; do not copy dimensions from the 2026-08 snapshot.

The Tree is not a GEDCOM engine. The existence of genealogical tags or import affordances does not mean round-trip GEDCOM parsing, validation, or export is complete.

## 7. Geneograph

### Board workspace

Geneograph has a board collection and editor. Boards support free-form placement, pan and zoom, selection and multi-selection, resizing, layering, grouping via panels, an inspector, and undo/redo for editor operations. Supported board objects include person cards, images, places, sticky notes, text, shapes, drawings, panels, and connections. A board may reference project entities or contain board-local content. The editor is a research composition surface, not a substitute for the structured Family Tree.

The toolbar exposes navigation/edit tools and split controls for Connect, Person, Notes & text, and Shapes. Connect, Draw, and Shapes can show short creation-setting strips under the toolbar. A strip changes subsequent creations on the current board; it does not rewrite existing objects or Canvas defaults. Its temporary state resets on board switch or reload.

### Person cards and board-person data

Person cards have four styles: Standard, Compact, Chart, and Portrait. Styles have separate formatting and displayed-information choices. Standard and Chart support left/right photo placement; Compact has no photo on the card; Portrait is photo-first. Board defaults and individual overrides govern appearance and layout. Gender-color application in the card inspector is a one-time snapshot of the relevant board palette, not a permanent lock to that palette. Reset clears resettable overrides while preserving card style and geometry.

The board person can use a project photo, a board asset, or a linked Tree-photo fallback; framing is stored as board-person crop data. An avatar choice updates all cards for that board person without changing the Family Tree photo. The card and inspector photo actions lead to the same staged picker/crop flow. Photo visibility on a particular card remains a separate layout toggle.

For card layout, treat style changes as a switch among saved style-specific settings. A Compact card's centered text should not overwrite Standard or Chart alignment. Show only information controls that affect the active style; in a mixed-style selection, expose only settings supported by every selected style. Standard has separate name and life-event alignment controls. Photo alignment applies to Standard and Chart only and is inactive when Photo is hidden, without discarding the chosen side.

### Canvas and object inspectors

With no object selected, the inspector edits Canvas appearance, default card appearance/layout, and default connection appearance. Canvas background patterns show visual previews. The object-highlight filter is view-only. Board card defaults can be neutral or gender-specific and apply to inherited properties; explicit card overrides remain independent.

Selecting one object shows identity controls in the header and relevant content, appearance, layout, and position/size sections. Person Card content has a profile-style hero, Edit, and Family Tree link flow. Images show source details and a replace action; image margins are transparent, and missing sources use a neutral placeholder. Other object types expose their applicable controls. Bulk person-card selection exposes appearance/layout controls with mixed states and a single Reset action; heterogeneous selection is more limited.

The inspector header provides rename, lock/unlock, and hide/show for an individual board object. A person card's Apply gender color command copies the current male, female, or unknown board appearance into editable overrides once. It remains available even if automatic gender coloring is off. The card Reset action clears appearance, formatting, and displayed-information overrides, but preserves style, position, dimensions, and sizing mode. Bulk edits should be one undoable operation and must change only the property the user touched.

### Connections and drawing

Connect can create visual lines and structured Family Tree relationships, with validity checked before committing a genealogical link. Visual line patterns include Solid, Dashed, Dotted, and alternating short/long dashes. The creation strip includes color, width, pattern, and visual arrowheads. Board connection defaults are inherited property by property; a selected connection can override or reset them. Arrowheads are visual only and are not stored for Family Tree relationships.

The in-progress connection preview snaps to a candidate socket. Relationship tips explain a valid partner, sibling, parent-child, or family-junction outcome; invalid targets show a reason. Empty-canvas right-click or double-click exits Connect mode, while object context menus remain available. Panning remains possible away from sockets.

Shapes and drawings have separate creation-strip settings, copied into new objects rather than saved as Canvas defaults. Inspector settings for an already-created object are independent of the active creation strip.

### Board files and export

`src/geneograph-board-files.js` validates and downloads editable `.ggboard` JSON and imports it into the current project. `src/geneograph-export.js` renders a board PNG for download, subject to browser image access and size limits. Board export/import is a real prototype capability, unlike generic project autosave. Validate board assets and project references when importing. Neither file format implies a server-side backup or collaboration model.

## 8. Albums and Archive

**Albums** organizes project photographs, album membership, associations to people and places, metadata, and primary portraits. It includes library and detail views, batch selection, photo/album workflows, and browser-local upload interactions. These update the prototype state; there is no durable media backend.

**Archive** organizes files, folders, sources, and linked research records. Browser-local document import supports PNG, JPEG, WebP, TXT, CSV, PDF, and DOCX, up to 20 MB each; imported file contents are available until reload. The document viewer has preview and download paths, using bundled parsing/sanitization libraries where needed. This is more than a visual mock, but it is not persistent document storage, OCR processing, or a production source-citation service. Record metadata and browser-local binary lifetime must be described separately.

## 9. Notes and Places

**Notes** supports project research notes and editor interactions, including links to relevant records. Quill supplies rich-text editing. The prototype should preserve safe rendering and distinguish note content from UI labels.

**Places** provides project place records and map-oriented browsing/search. Map tiles and geographic search depend on the configured provider and network, so map-unavailable states must not block non-map choices. The Geneograph Add/Change Place modal combines project places, map results, and a board-only option in one results list. Selecting a map result adds a project Place; choosing board-only does not. Merely typing a query never creates a place.

## 10. Publish and other unfinished capabilities

`src/publish.js` contains a publication wizard and previews, but Publish is disabled in the active module navigation. Its export and draft confirmation paths are simulated; no real report, book, chart, GEDCOM, or GEDZip artifact is generated there. Do not list Publish as a working top-level module or mistake Geneograph PNG export for a general Publish pipeline.

Other important boundaries:

- No durable project database, account authentication, permissions, or collaborative synchronization.
- No real GEDCOM parser/import workflow or verified round-trip interchange.
- No production upload/storage service for photos and archive files.
- No general server-side map/geocoding authority; mapping relies on browser configuration and an external provider.
- A local undo stack and a downloaded board file do not constitute project-wide persistence or backup.

### Capability and lifetime matrix

| Workflow | Current result | Persistence boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create a blank project or edit sample records | Changes the browser's in-memory project graph | Reload restores the seeded state. |
| Import GEDCOM | Opens a concept flow, not a parser | No imported genealogy is committed. |
| Edit a Geneograph board | Interactive objects, settings, and undo/redo | Current session unless an editable board file is downloaded. |
| Export/import a Geneograph `.ggboard` | Real validated board JSON download and current-project import | Explicit file transfer, not automatic save. |
| Export Geneograph PNG | Real browser-side image download | Static image only; it is not an editable board. |
| Add a browser-local Archive document | Real local preview/download path for supported formats | Imported contents are lost on reload. |
| Use map search/tiles | External provider-backed where configured | Availability depends on configuration and network. |
| Use Publish wizard | Preview/simulated output interaction | No generated publication file. |

## 11. Responsive design and accessibility

The workspace spans desktop and narrow layouts. Toolbars may overflow, inspectors compress, and long modal result lists should retain reachable actions. On phones, creation strips remain one horizontally scrollable row. Use flexible columns for inspector fields, avoid clipping translated labels, and keep touch targets usable without overlapping canvas controls.

Semantic buttons, labeled icon actions, focus indicators, accessible names, selected/pressed states, Escape dismissal, and focus return are part of the interaction contract. Native button rows are preferred for searchable modal choices. Hover-only affordances need a keyboard and touch path. Canvas operations and visual connection feedback must not steal socket clicks or prevent pan. Respect reduced-motion behavior where provided. English and Russian both need layout and keyboard checks.

### Verification map

| Change area | Minimum checks |
| --- | --- |
| Shared person or relationship data | People, Profile, Family Tree, Geneograph link resolution, and project scoping. |
| Geneograph card presentation | Four styles, long names and dates, photo/initials/Photo off, inherited versus custom appearance, minimum and enlarged sizes. |
| Board interaction | Pan/zoom, selection, touch and keyboard controls, inspector, bulk mixed states, undo/redo, board switch. |
| Connections | Valid/invalid relationship targets, visual lines, all patterns, arrowheads, route editing, hover/focus feedback, right-click exit. |
| Media and files | Missing assets, local upload lifetime, board import/export, Archive preview/download, Cancel and reload. |
| Localization and responsiveness | English/Russian copy, translated label fit, 320px phone through desktop, focus order, open menus and modals. |

The `tests/` directory contains browser regressions for these areas, including Geneograph editor/connection cases, place search, photo pickers, mobile layouts, and project navigation. Test names are task-specific rather than a single all-in-one suite; select the relevant files and supplement them with an actual browser/console pass.

## 12. Engineering guidance

1. Start at `src/index.html` and follow its load order. Change stylesheet/script order only after checking global dependencies and the final overrides layer.
2. Search targeted functions/selectors in the relevant feature file; several files are too large to inspect wholesale. Keep edits near the owning renderer and event bindings.
3. Reuse design tokens, icons, localized strings, shared media and paint controls, and established modal/inspector patterns.
4. Keep project IDs, board assets, person references, and per-property default/override semantics intact. A view-only choice should not mutate saved records.
5. Validate transitions, not only appearance: selection, Cancel, undo/redo, reload, import/export, missing assets, external-service failures, and mixed bulk values.
6. Run focused browser regressions in `tests/`, inspect the console, and use `git diff --check`. For structural changes, open `src/index.html` locally and exercise the relevant workflow at desktop and phone widths.

## 13. Production direction

The prototype is a substantial interaction reference, not a deployable production architecture. A product implementation should first define durable project-scoped schemas and stable identifiers, then extract and test pure relationship, date, place, board-validation, and appearance-resolution logic. Add persistence, authenticated access, media/document storage, and reliable import/export around those contracts. Implement GEDCOM and publication generation as separately verified pipelines. Keep English/Russian localization and accessible keyboard/touch operation as release criteria, not later polish.

Technology choices for a production client, backend, or database are not decided by this prototype. The old document's single-file extraction plan and prescribed stack have been superseded by the current multi-file static application; future architecture should be chosen against actual data and service requirements.
